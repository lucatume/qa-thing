      <h2>Intercooler 0.2.0 &rarr; 0.3.x Upgrade Guide</h2>

      <p>Fresh on the heels of saying that we were adopting <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> in 0.2.0, we
      promptly violated Semantic Versioning.</p>

      <p>Last time, promise!  &#9786;</p>

      <h4>Upgrade Steps</h4>

      <p>Here are steps to upgrade from Intercooler <code>0.2.0</code> to <code>0.3.0</code>:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Rename the <code>ic-load-on</code> attribute to <code>ic-trigger-on</code>.</li>
        <li>All intercooler events that were previously named <code>ic.*</code> should be reversed to <code>*.ic</code> - this
        is more consistent with jQuery event name spacing.</li>
        <li>All logging related methods, <code>setLogger</code>, <code>log</code>, <code>setLogLevel</code> and
          <code>logLevels</code> were removed from the API and should be replaced by jQuery event listeners for the
        <code>log.ic</code> event.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Not too bad, but still, sorry about that!</p>
