I have released intercooler v1.0.2, available on the main site, as well as through bower and NPM.

  <http://intercoolerjs.org/download.html>

The changes in this release are:

* We now try to include the value of the button clicked when submitting a form by including the focused button value, if any.
* Thanks to OvermindDL1's build work, we now play well with the Node ecosystem
