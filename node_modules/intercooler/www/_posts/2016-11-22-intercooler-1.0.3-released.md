I have released intercooler v1.0.3, available on the main site, as well as through bower and NPM.

  <http://intercoolerjs.org/download.html>

The changes in this release are:

* Added the `ic-action-target` attribute, allowing for a distinct target for the `ic-action` attribute.
* Added the `ic-sse-src` attribute, allowing intercooler to utilize [Server Sent Events](/docs.html#sse)
* Added the `ic-swap-style` attribute, making append/prepend explicit attribute-driven behaviors.
* The `ic-poll` attribute now does not ignore dependencies.
