I have released intercooler v0.9.7, available on the main site, as well as through bower.

  <http://intercoolerjs.org/download.html>

The changes in this release are:

* Support for setting title with the `X-IC-Title` response header
* Support for reading and writing local variables stored in `localStorage` using 
  the `ic-local-vars` attribute and `X-IC-Set-Local-Vars` response header.
* Support the `autofocus` attribute in intercooler AJAX responses.

**The Road to 1.0**

v0.9.7 is the fourth release candidate for intercooler v1.0.  My goal now is to release v1.0 in July or August,
depending on how exploration of DOM-merging goes.
