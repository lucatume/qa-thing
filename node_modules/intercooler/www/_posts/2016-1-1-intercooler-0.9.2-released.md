I have released intercooler v0.9.2, available on the main site, as well as through bower.

<http://intercoolerjs.org/download.html>

The big change in this release is that intercooler now has support for file upload.

I also made a slight tweak to the semantics of the ic-action attribute to make it more compatible with jQuery
actions:

**The Road to 1.0**

I'm hoping to be able to find some time today to finish my last pre-1.0 item:

  * [https://github.com/LeadDyno/intercooler-js/issues/60](https://github.com/LeadDyno/intercooler-js/issues/60) - an option for a data-prefix

When I'm done with that I will release a v0.9.3, which will be intercooler 1.0-alpha1.

**A Blog!**

Finally, I'm happy to announce that I have set up a blog on the intercooler website:

<http://intercoolerjs.org/blog.html>

I'd love to have intercooler users contribute posts (particularly about how to user intercooler on various server-side
platforms).  If you'd like to contribute, simply fork the intercooler codebase and add a markdown file here:

[https://github.com/LeadDyno/intercooler-js/tree/master/www/_posts](https://github.com/LeadDyno/intercooler-js/tree/master/www/_posts)

Then issue a pull request and I'll merge it and publish it out.

Happy New Year!
